## Load Packages

In this section, we install and load the necessary packages. 

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
### Install packages. If you haven't install the dplyr package, please uncomment the line below to install it.
#install.packages('dplyr') # required only once.

### load libraries for use in current working session
library('dplyr')

```

## Import Data

In this section, we import the necessary data for this lab.

```{r import, include=FALSE}
### set your working directory
# use setwd to set your working directory

# you can also go to session-> set working directory -> choose directory
# working directory is the path to the folder and not file

# If you would like to get the current working directory, run the following line
getwd() 

# make sure the path of the directory is correct, i.e., where you have stored your data
setwd("/Users/phaniteja/Desktop/mgt585/Data")


### import data file
# read the movies file using read.csv
superbowl <- read.csv(file = "superbowl.csv",fileEncoding = 'UTF-8-BOM')

```

# Homework Assignment 2: Super Bowl Caselet (Part 2)

You are hired as a Business Analyst to help the manager to find out if spending millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads creates social media buzz.

As a second step, carry out descriptive analysis on superbowl.csv data. There are some questions for each sections that you need to answer.

## Section 1: Univariate Statistics

Task 1, compute the *mean*, *variance*, and *standard deviation* of **adspend** for each **new_brand** before the Super Bowl and after the Super Bowl. Hint: you may use dplyr functions group_by() and summarise(). 

Note that the superbowl column is 0 for the weeks before super bowl and 1 for the weeks of or after super bowl.

```{r **Task 1, Section 1**}
superbowl %>% group_by(new_brand, superbowl) %>% summarise(avg_adsend=mean(adspend), var_adspend=var(adspend), sd_adspend=sd(adspend))

```


Task 2, compute the *mean* and *standard deviation* of **volume** (the number of total mentions form social media), **pos** (the number of positive mentions) and **neg** (the number of negative mentions) for each **new_brand** before the Super Bowl and after the Super Bowl.

```{r **Task 2, Section 1**}
superbowl %>% group_by(new_brand, superbowl) %>% summarise(avg_vol=mean(volume), sd_vol=sd(volume), avg_pos=mean(pos), sd_pos=sd(pos), avg_neg=mean(neg), sd_neg=sd(neg))

```


Then, answer the following questions. Please write your answers after **Response**:

**Questions**: 

1. What brand has the **highest mean ad spend** after the Super Bowl? Has the mean ad spending increased after the Super Bowl for that brand? By how much?

2. What brand has the **highest mean** volume of mentions after the Super Bowl? What brand has the **lowest mean** volume of **positive** mentions after the Super Bowl?


**Responses**: 
**PLEASE ADD YOUR RESPONSES HERE**

1. Beetle brand has the highest mean ad spend after the superbowl. Yes, the mean ad spending increased after the super bowl for beetle brand by 888.83. 


2. Camaro brand has the highest mean volume of mentions after the superbowl which is 93613. Whereas, CR-Z brand has the lowest mean volume of positive mentions after the superbowl which is 339. 




### Section 2: Bivariate Statistics

Task 1, compute the *correlation* between **adspend** and **volume** in superbowl dataset, before the Super Bowl and after the Super Bowl. Similarly, compute the *correlation* between **adspend** and **pos**, and between  **adspend** and **neg** in superbowl dataset, before the Super Bowl and after the Super Bowl. Hint: you may use dplyr functions group_by() and summarise().

```{r **Task 1, Section 2**}

superbowl %>% group_by(superbowl) %>% summarise(cor_ads_vol=cor(adspend,volume), cor_ads_pos=cor(adspend,pos), cor_ads_neg=cor(adspend,neg))

```

Task 2, for each **new_brand**, compute the *correlation* between **adspend** and **volume**, between **adspend** and **pos**, and between **adspend** and **neg**, before the Super Bowl and after the Super Bowl.

```{r **Task 2, Section 2**}

superbowl %>% group_by(new_brand, superbowl) %>% summarise(cor_ads_vol=cor(adspend,volume), cor_ads_pos=cor(adspend,pos), cor_ads_neg=cor(adspend,neg))


```

Then, answer the following questions. Please write your answers after **Response**:

**Questions**: 

1. What is the *correlation* between **adspend** and **pos** before AND after the Super Bowl? Does that imply a positive, negative or no relationship? Is the relationship strong? What about the relationship between **adspend** and **neg** before AND after the Super Bowl?

2. Which brand's ad spending did actually create a social media buzz (either positive or negative mentions)? Use both univariate and bivariate statistics for each brand to support your answer. 

**Responses**: 
**PLEASE ADD YOUR RESPONSES HERE**

1. The correlation between ad spend and pos is 0.975 and 0.0536 before and after the superbowl respectively. In both cases the relationship between ad spend and pos is positive. However, the relationship was strong before the superbowl and weak after the superbowl.The correlation between adspend and neg is 0.979 and 0.0495 before and after the superbowl. Here also the relation is positive before and after superbowl. In this case too the relation was strong before superbowl and weak after superbowl.



2. Beetle is the only brand that created the social media buzz(both positive and negative).From the bivariate statistics we got from above codes we know that there was negative relation between ad spend and volume,pos,neg before super bowl but turned into positive relation after super bowl.Also there was a huge jump in mean of volume mentions in pos and neg for Beetle brand.
