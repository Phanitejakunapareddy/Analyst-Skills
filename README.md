# SQL Assignments - MIS 673

This repository contains SQL scripts developed for various assignments in the MIS 673 course. The assignments cover database creation, data insertion, querying, and analysis using SQL Server.

## Files Included

- `Assignment4_phani_teja.sql`  
  Contains SQL code for creating tables related to platforms, viewers, shows, actors, awards, genres, directors, and their relationships. Includes sample data inserts and basic SELECT queries.

- `SQLQuery_1_Assignment5.sql`  
  Contains SQL queries to retrieve student information, show details, viewer ratings, and aggregated data such as counts and listings of shows by genre, viewer ratings, and platform usage.

- `SQLQuery_1_assignment6.sql`  
  Contains advanced queries for enrollment statistics, student ages, course details, genre average ratings, platform viewer counts, director show counts, actor roles, and show awards.

## How to Use

1. Load the schema and data by running the script `Assignment4_phani_teja.sql` on your SQL Server database. This will create the tables and insert sample data.

2. Run queries from `SQLQuery_1_Assignment5.sql` and `SQLQuery_1_assignment6.sql` to retrieve insights and practice advanced SQL querying.

3. Modify and extend queries as needed for further analysis or assignments.

## Learning Outcomes

- Designing normalized database schemas with appropriate keys and constraints.
- Writing DDL statements to create tables and manage relationships.
- Inserting bulk data for realistic datasets.
- Performing SELECT queries with filtering, joining, aggregation, and sorting.
- Applying advanced SQL features such as grouping, HAVING clauses, and subqueries.
